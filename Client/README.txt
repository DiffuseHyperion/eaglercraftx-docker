Due to the nature of EaglercraftX's client, I will not provide a download for the client. YOU MUST PROVIDE IT YOURSELF.

To do this, first create a folder called "client" in this folder. This is case-sensitive.

Then, follow the normal compiling steps for EaglercraftX's client and set the output directory to the "client" folder you just created.

Make sure to turn off offline downloads, this takes up unnecessary space, although the script will remove them if it exists.

Once the client has finished compiling, run build_image.sh. You can either provide no arguments, which then it will produce the image with the tag diffusehyperion/eaglercraftxclient,
or provide your own tag as an argument.

After that, run the image like any other image.
